			<h2>The famous Rage spell</h2>
			<p>This is one of the most used spells in the Meta because it not only makes your troops faster but as it gets dropped onto the 
			field, destroys all little troops and also hurts everything else too.</p>
			<h2>Ways to use the card</h2>
			<p>To use the Rage spell effectively in Clash Royale, deploy it strategically when your troops are engaged in a
			battle, maximizing its impact on both offense and defense. Timing is crucial; activate the Rage spell just as your troops 
			reach enemy structures or encounter a group of opponents, ensuring they benefit from increased attack speed and movement.</p>
